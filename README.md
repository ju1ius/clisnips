Ever found yourself in this kind of embarrassing situation?
You use the great [Terminator](http://gnometerminator.blogspot.fr/p/introduction.html) terminal emulator ?

It provides a snippet library (similar to clicompanion2) in which you can save/edit/search/recall
your commands (or any code snippet for use in i.e. ipython or irb).


## Requirements

 * Python >= 2.7
 * [Terminator](http://gnometerminator.blogspot.fr/p/introduction.html)


## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ju1ius/clisnips.git clisnips
cd clisnips

```

Open Terminator, go to Preferences > Plugins and enable CliSnipsMenu.
